          About Panda:
          <br>
          Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest China, 
          where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. They must eat around 26 to 84 pounds 
          of it every day, depending on what part of the bamboo they are eating. They use their 
          enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs. Driven nearly to extinction by 
          habitat loss and poaching, these elusive and secretive mammals are among the rarest in the world, 
          with only an estimated 1,800 remaining in the wild. The low reproductive rate of giant pandas makes 
          them more vulnerable to threats and extinction.

          Resolving the Issues:
          <br>
          Creating new reserves and linking up existing panda populations are key to the species' future. 
          The Chinese authorities have increased the number of panda reserves to 67 in recent years, but 
          this still leaves around 1/3rd of wild pandas outside protected areas.The Chinese government, in 
          partnership with WWF, has also developed bamboo corridors to link pockets of forest, allowing the 
          pandas within them to move to new areas, find more food and meet more potential breeding mates.But 
          with panda habitat continuing to be fragmented by roads, railways and other human development, additional 
          corridors will be needed to connect isolated panda populations.
